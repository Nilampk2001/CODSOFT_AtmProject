# CODSOFT_AtmProject

This project involves developing an ATM machine simulation in Java. The simulation allows users to interact with a virtual ATM, offering options such as withdrawing money, depositing funds, and checking their account balance.

Key components include:

ATM Class: This class represents the ATM machine and includes a user interface with methods for various transactions:

withdraw(amount): Allows the user to withdraw a specified amount, checking if there is sufficient balance.
deposit(amount): Enables the user to deposit funds into their account.
checkBalance(): Displays the current balance in the user's account.
Bank Account Class: Represents the user's bank account, storing and managing the account balance.

User Input Validation: Ensures that all transactions are valid, such as checking for sufficient funds before a withdrawal or preventing negative deposits.

User Feedback: Provides clear and appropriate messages based on the success or failure of each transaction, enhancing the user experience.
